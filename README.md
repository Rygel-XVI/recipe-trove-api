# README

This is a capstone project to create a SPA with JS/React utilizing a Rails API.
The Front-end can be found <a href="https://github.com/Rygel-XVI/recipe-trove-client">here</a>.

This app allows the user to create and modify recipes and ingredients to track your cookbook.

This will be an ongoing project and a login/logout system will be added as well as an evolving design as I develop my CSS and Front-End skills.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
